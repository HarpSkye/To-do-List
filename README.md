# Description:
### This project uses React and React DOM to create a to do list that is able to perform CRUD: Create, Remove, Update and Delete.
### In order to make it more fun, instead of using the traditional to do list design. I am trying to build a more RPG version.

# Improve:
### For the future improvement, I would like to add Super Mario Coins. When I finish one tasks, the tasks will be strike through and super mario is going to have one more coin.
